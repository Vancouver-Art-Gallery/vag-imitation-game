*The Imitation Game: Visual Culture in the Age of Artificial Intelligence* began with a simple proposition—could we tell a compelling story of the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of visual culture? Would it be possible to demonstrate that AI is at the forefront of a social, scientific and cultural change that will reshape everything we see and touch? Could an exhibition give a recognizable form to these extraordinary changes and inspire engagement with these new ideas and media?

Today AI is utilized everywhere and has become a fundamental tool in all areas of creativity and cultural production. Our daily selections of social media, music, news, videos or dinner recipes are guided by AI that have been monitoring our choices for years. That phone that usually sits only a few centimetres from your hand is, more often than not, used to make, send or retrieve an image. And every image you see there has been assessed and altered by an AI. We may still listen for the click of the shutter, adjust the aperture or make a choice between a black and white or coloured image, but those “choices” only mask an artificial intelligence that seamlessly controls your original image from the moment you open your phone to the instant you send it to your friend. While image-based technologies today still retain some of the language of 20th century photography, it is, in truth, a radically different medium of creativity. Today’s “photograph” is entirely the product of algorithmic expressions that manipulate data captured when you point your phone toward your friend’s face. That data is received, assessed and rapidly subjected to a wide range of manipulations that strike a carefully calculated balance between traditional conventions of seeing and radical new concepts of perception and understanding. The billions of digital images that are produced every day are a testament to the successful application of artificial intelligence in this simple and ubiquitous mode of cultural production.

This is a story that is repeated in every field of visual culture. Art, architecture, fashion, film, graphic design, animation, videogames, and urban and industrial design are all deeply affected by profound advances in machine learning and its many subcategories of application, including artificial neural networks, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), Reinforcement Learning, etc. These programming advances, together with huge leaps forward in the design and production of computing hardware, have laid the groundwork for unprecedented growth in AI. 

There is no doubt that the future will be shaped by continuing advances in AI. It is incumbent on each of us to take on a greater understanding and awareness of the profound importance of AI, the means by which it shapes our lives and the ways in which we interact with others. 

I would like to thank the co-curators Glenn Entis and Bruce Grenville for bringing their unique perspectives to this exhibition and publication. Glenn Entis is a widely recognized pioneer in the field of computer animation and videogames, and an active presence in that field for more than forty years. He has had a long-standing relationship with the Vancouver Art Gallery through his role as an advisor and community advocate on past visual culture-focused exhibitions. Working closely with the Gallery’s Senior Curator Bruce Grenville, together they have conceived this timely and persuasive exhibition. 

The development of this exhibition provided an opportunity to work with a wide range of collaborators from this community and far beyond, and I am grateful for their support. A small team of highly respected international advisors provided access to art and ideas from their respective fields and communities. Locally, individual advisors also shared their expertise and access to technologies and research that were of tremendous value to the project. The Public Humanities Hub at the University of British Columbia hosted a roundtable on artificial intelligence that provided introductions to a wealth of research at that University and the opportunity to collaborate on a symposium on the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in cultural production. Three key components of the exhibition were produced in a very successful collaboration with the staff and graduate students of the Centre for Digital Media in Vancouver. 

The co-curators worked closely with Michael Lis of Goodweather Studio, who played a critical role in the exhibition’s design, conceiving an engaging and compelling framework for the exhibition thesis. The Vancouver Art Gallery’s Museum Services team brought those designs to life with an enthusiastic delight in new installation challenges, a thoughtful precision and a wealth of experience. 

This unique digital publication was designed by Michael Lis and produced by Stephanie Rebick in her capacity as Director of Publishing and Content Strategy at the Gallery. Their goal to extend the outreach of the exhibition publication and establish a framework for future digital publishing was entirely successful. 

We are thankful for the individual, institutional and corporate lenders to the exhibition who shared their unique insights, creativity and experience, and to the many artists, designers, architects, programmers and cultural producers who created the extraordinary art and ideas that formed this exhibition. 

Financial support for The Imitation Game was essential to the success of the exhibition. We are grateful for the generous support of Jane Irwin and Ross Hill, The Poseley Family, and Rick Erickson and Donna Partridge. Nicola Wealth was a supporting sponsor, and the AI Youth Programs Sponsor was The Dr. Michael Smith Science Fair Endowment. Additional support was received from The S.M. Blair Family Foundation and Traction on Demand. I would also like to acknowledge The Richardson Family, the Gallery’s Visionary Partner for Scholarship and Publications, for their support of this digital publishing initiative. 

Finally, I extend my deep appreciation to the Board of Trustees of the Vancouver Art Gallery for their continued commitment to our ambitious and interdisciplinary programs.
