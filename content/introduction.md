*The Imitation Game* surveys the extraordinary uses (and abuses) of artificial intelligence[^1] (AI) in the production of contemporary visual culture. The exhibition follows a chronological narrative that first examines the development of artificial intelligence from the 1950s to the present. Building on this foundation, it then emphasizes the explosive growth of AI over the past decade across creative disciplines---including animation, architecture, art, fashion, graphic design, urban design and video games.

From the early moments of its creation, AI has captured the imaginations of cultural producers around the world. The idea that machines could think and express themselves independently of their human makers has been received with great skepticism, some joy, and a healthy dose of anxiety.

Unsurprisingly, much of the early research on AI engaged with human-centred ideas of imitation and emulation. Most notably, in 1950, Alan Turing formulated an "imitation game" for testing a machine's capacity to display intelligent behaviour in a manner that would be indistinguishable from natural human behaviour. Around the same time, researchers began to explore the possibility of an artificial neural network[^2] modelled directly on the human brain.

These early investigations set frameworks for much of the invention that followed in the 20th century. In the past decade, huge advances in the design and production of computing hardware have laid the groundwork for an unprecedented growth of AI as a fundamental tool with wide creative applications.

The exhibition begins with an interactive introduction inviting visitors to identify diverse areas of cultural production influenced by AI. Twenty "objects of wonder" have been selected to offer a chronological history of AI and visual culture. And two special projects by artists Sougwen Chung and Scott Eaton offer compelling insights into the collaborative and creative powers of AI.

This exhibition is organized by the Vancouver Art Gallery and curated by Bruce Grenville, Senior Curator and Glenn Entis, Guest Curator

## An Interactive Introduction

{% figure 'interactiveintro' %}

This interactive introduction invites visitors to explore the range of images, objects and ideas that shape this exhibition. Visitors may be familiar with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in their encounters with the preference engines[^3] that select their online music, videos or shopping, but the use of AI as an essential tool in a wide range of creative processes is often invisible.

The interactive installation employs a basic form of AI that combines computer vision, machine learning and neural networks that analyze hand gestures in real time and trigger an appropriate response to visitors' interactions. The images and information on this wall are addressed in greater depth throughout the exhibition.

The interactive Introduction to *The Imitation Game* is the result of a collaboration with Vancouver's Centre for Digital Media, under the direction of Larry Bafia. Graduate students in this program worked as a team to design, program and produce this wall. Many thanks to that talented team:

-   Allyson Zhong -- Project Manager/UX
-   Luisa Martinez Ria√±o -- UX/UI
-   Sooq Won -- Video Artist/Producer
-   Farbod Tabaei -- Concept Artist/Developer
-   Pieteke MacMahon -- Software Developer/UX/UI Designer
-   Larry Bafia -- team advisor and program director

Cindy Shi contributed post-production programming support.

The Centre for Digital Media was founded in 2007 and is a unique graduate program whose degree is imprinted with the seals of its four partner institutions: University of British Columbia, Emily Carr University of Art + Design, Simon Fraser University and British Columbia Institute of Technology.

## Notes

[^1]: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.

[^2]: Neural networks are computing systems with interconnected nodes that work much like neurons in the human brain. Using algorithms, they can recognize hidden patterns and correlations in raw data, cluster and classify it, and---over time---continuously learn and improve.

[^3]: A preference engine, or a recommender system, or a recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the 'rating' or 'preference' a user would give to an item.
