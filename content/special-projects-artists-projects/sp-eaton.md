Scott Eaton is an American-born artist based in London. As a long-time student of the human figure, Eaton has built a commercial database of human figures---both still and in motion---and has produced an extensive body of photographic and hand-drawn figurative work. He teaches human anatomy and figure drawing for artists, and consults for a variety of video game and animation production houses.

The work in this room addresses one of the oldest subjects of art: the human body. But the tools used for this exploration employ some of the most recent and sophisticated advances in artificial intelligence: neural networks.

The "Bodies" neural network that produced the human bodies displayed here was designed and trained by the artist with over 25,000 photographs of carefully lit and staged human figures. As neural networks can only recognize and produce the types of images on which they were trained, the "Bodies" network can only "see" the human form.

Consequently, in its interactions with Eaton, the network can only produce the human body. The network responds to lines drawn by Eaton by attempting to give a fleshy surface and lighting to that form. No matter what image Eaton feeds into the network, the digital output will be a human body that is shaped by the parameters of the input image. Draw a line, get back a body part. Capture fluids in motion, get back fluid bodies in motion.

*Entangled II* was produced using high-speed video of fluid movement shot with macro lenses, then processed through a custom pix2pixHD model (a type of neural network) trained on the artist's "Bodies" dataset of more than 25,000 images of the human body in motion.

To create this work, a large composition, hand-drawn by the artist, was processed by a custom neural network that was trained on the artist's "Bodies" dataset. Eaton was inspired by the many large-scale depictions of the Last Judgment that were produced during the Renaissance. The computer processing required to render the complex volumes and shading for each body in such a large-scale and highly detailed image posed a significant technical challenge. To resolve this problem, Eaton produced the image in smaller, tiled pieces, which he then reassembled for printing.

Sophisticated neural networks are complex and can produce surprising results. Extensive experimentation is necessary to tune the design and training of a neural network, and to discover what it can do. *Caffeinated Diversions* presents a selection of Scott Eaton's daily exercises to discover what he can produce with the AI neural networks he has trained.

Each starts with a sketch---a simple line drawing. Then, the neural network takes over as it tries to process the sketch through the patterns on which it was trained; in this case, thousands of photographs of human bodies in various positions taken by the artist. As Eaton describes it: "in some ways the neural network was training me in reverse to draw differently, to get it to do the right thing."

In this new work, the initial output is produced by a StyleGan3 generator trained on the artist's "Bodies" dataset, and then processed by a custom Pix2PixHD model which has been trained on simple geometric shapes. The final output is rendered in Octane Render.
