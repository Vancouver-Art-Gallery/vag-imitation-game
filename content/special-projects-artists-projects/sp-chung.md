Sougwen Chung is a Chinese-Canadian artist and researcher currently based in London, England. Over the past decade, she has engaged in research that links humans and machines in an intricate and compelling collaboration. More recently she has extended that collaboration to include a broader range of ecologies---seeking to produce new modes of creativity that blur the conventional boundaries between human and non-human knowledge.

Her installation for this exhibition offers a selected introduction to some of the key bodies of work she has produced in the last five years. With an extensive background in computational science and art, Chung utilizes machine learning, computer vision, neural networks and advanced robotics in a speculative practice that finds meaning in flow, change, entanglement and indeterminacy.

Performance is a critical element of Chung's practice---where human and machine meet in their most intimate and inextricable engagement. In a recent text Chung called for a recognition of "machine intelligence, flux and unknown destinations. Machine co-creation---not a replication or automation of human endeavour but a mechanism (mysticism) developed toward the transformation of the human subject. A form of mysticism."

The artist collected and scanned samples of her previous drawings and sketches---100 of which were shown in the exhibition---to produce a memory bank for D.O.U.G.\_2. She has since continued to add drawings focusing on gesture and colour palette. Together, they constitute a collective memory that the robotic arm could draw on when creating these two works.

The drawing robots that were installed on the centre platform collaborated with the artist in the production of the painting you see there. They are part of a "family" or "swarm" of robots that work collectively---with Chung and with each other---to produce gestures that reflect their interactions in a shared space. In part, the robots' movements are based on data gathered by surveillance cameras in public spaces. The data is extracted through algorithms that capture optical flow,[^1] which can be defined as the pattern of motion of objects in a visual scene---velocity, direction, density and dwell time. Two paintings from this series---*Dwell Study* (2018) and *Direction Study* (2018)---were installed nearby.

Optical flow is a critical field of study in computer vision and machine movement, and Chung's project emerged in part from the Experiments in Arts and Technology (E.A.T.) residency at the legendary Bell Labs. The E.A.T. collective first paired engineers from Bell Labs with artists in 1966, and this visionary partnership continues to support collaborative artistic projects that engage emergent technologies.

[^1]: Optical flow is a technique used to describe image motion. It is usually applied to a series of images that have a small time step between them, for example, video frames. Optical flow calculates a velocity for points within the images, and provides an estimation of where points could be in the next image sequence.

In this video work, Sougwen Chung establishes the framework for an ongoing project that is connected to nature through a process linked to the artist's biorhythms. Here, Chung explores new modes of relation between humans, plants and machines.
