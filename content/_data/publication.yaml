    bio: "Glenn Entis is a computer animation and video game pioneer. In the early 1980s, he co-founded Pacific Data Images (PDI), the computer graphics studio that later became the northern studio of Dreamworks Animation. Glenn received an Academy Award for Technical Achievement Award from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts for his design and implementation of PDI’s animation software. In 1996, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg recruited him to run Dreamworks Interactive, their joint venture with Microsoft to develop video games. As CEO, Glenn oversaw a successful slate of titles, including the critically acclaimed and best-selling Medal of Honor series. When Electronic Arts (EA) acquired Dreamworks Interactive in 2000, Glenn moved on to the EA Worldwide Studios executive team, eventually becoming SVP, Chief Visual Officer and Chief Technical Officer. He left EA in 2008 to co-found Vanedge Capital, a successful venture capital fund based in Vancouver, BC. Along the way, Glenn became a workshopohilic—convinced that workshops, in many formats and contexts, make powerful and reliable tools for unlocking the creative potential of teams. Glenn currently advises a variety of companies in animation, video games and virtual reality."
