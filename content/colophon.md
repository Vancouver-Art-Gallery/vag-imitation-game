The Vancouver Art Gallery respectfully acknowledges its location on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territories of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish) and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) peoples, and honours the Indigenous stewards of the land whose rich cultures are fundamental to artistic life in our province and the work of the Gallery.
