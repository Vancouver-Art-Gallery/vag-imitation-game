**A**

Algorithm
: An algorithm is a set of instructions or a recipe for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.

Algorithmic Bias
: A phenomenon that occurs when an AI algorithm produces results that are systemically prejudiced due to erroneous assumptions in the machine learning process.

Algorithmic Design or Computational Design
: Algorithmic design or computational design is defined as the ways in which design meaning, intentions and knowledge are constructed through computational thinking, representing, sensing and making.

Artificial Intelligence
: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.

**B**

Biometric Surveillance Technologies
: Biometric technology is the use of human characteristics to identify individuals and is a form of surveillance. The word biometric is derived from the Greek words bio (which means life) and metric (which means to measure). Common forms of biometrics are fingerprint scanners and face identification.

Boids
: Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds.

**C**

Co-naturality
: Co-naturality refers to a sympathy that exists been two objects that share the same nature.

Computer Interface
: The human-machine interface, also called user interface or human-computer interface, is the means by which humans and computers communicate with each other. The human-machine interface includes the hardware and software that is used to translate user (i.e. human) input into commands and to present results to the user.

Computer Vision
: Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs.

Cybernetics
: Norbert Wiener introduced the term "cybernetics" in 1948 and described it as "the science of control and communications in the animal and machine."

**D**

Dataset
: A dataset is a collection of data that can be used to train an algorithm with the goal of finding predictable patterns inside the whole dataset.

Deep Learning
: Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers.

Deepfakes
: Deepfakes (a portmanteau of \"deep learning\" and \"fake\") are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness.

**F**

Facial Recognition System
: A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services. It works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.

Funicular Structure
: The funicular concept can be best described and visualized with cables or chains, suspended from two points, that adjust their form for any load in tension.

**G**

Game Theory
: Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions among rational agents.

Generative Adversarial Network
: A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks in which two neural networks train each other by competing in a zero-sum game, where one agent's gain is another agent's loss.

**L**

Lissajous Curve
: A Lissajous curve is the graph of a system of parametric equations which describe complex harmonic motion.

**M**

Machine Learning
: Machine learning is an application of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

The Mechanical Turk
: The Turk, also known as the Mechanical Turk or Automaton Chess Player, was a fake chess-playing machine constructed in the late 18th century.

**N**

Neural Network
: Neural networks are computing systems with interconnected nodes that work much like neurons in the human brain. Using algorithms, they can recognize hidden patterns and correlations in raw data, cluster and classify it, and--over time--continuously learn and improve.

**O**

Optical Flow
: Optical flow is a technique used to describe image motion. It is usually applied to a series of images that have a small time step between them, for example, video frames. Optical flow calculates a velocity for points within the images, and provides an estimation of where points could be in the next image sequence.

**P**

Parametric Design
: Parametric design is understood as a process where a description of a problem is created using variables. By changing these variables a range of alternative solutions can be created, then based on some criteria a final solution selected.

Preference Engine
: A preference engine, or a recommender system, is a subclass of information filtering systems that seeks to predict the \"rating\" or \"preference\" a user would give to an item.

Prompt Engineering
: Prompt engineering or prompt programming is an interesting way to interact with GPT-3 neural network systems. It basically involves creating clever text-based scripts that make GPT-3 perform the tasks you desire.

**R**

Reinforcement Learning
: Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

**S**

System Dynamics
: System dynamics is an approach to understanding the nonlinear behaviour of complex systems over time using stocks, flows, internal feedback loops, table functions and time delays.

**T**

Turing Test
: The Turing test, originally called "the imitation game" by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine\'s ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.

**W**

WordNet
: WordNet is the name used for lexical databases derived from the original Princeton WordNet; they group words into synonym sets and interlink them using lexical and conceptual-semantic relations. These databases are used for computational linguistics and natural language processing.
