Responding to a complex building site, the Bjarke Ingels Group utilized the power of parametric design to produce a Vancouver landmark. Vancouver House was designed in response to a number of unique parameters that resulted from its constrained site, an option for expanded airspace, and a commitment to public space at the foot of the tower.

In an extraordinary feat of design, the building structure emerges from a triangular floorplate that twists and expands slowly as it rises, achieving a rectangular form near the top of its 59 storeys.

The building's design relies heavily on the capacity of computational design to manage the variety and incremental shifting of form as the building rises and rotates.
