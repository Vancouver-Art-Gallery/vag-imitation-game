Amber Frid-Jimenez is a Vancouver-based interdisciplinary artist with a background in computational design and the creation of experimental computer programs, platforms and applications.

*Après Ballet mécanique* (2018) is a video created by Frid-Jimenez that uses artificial intelligence to generate a new configuration of Fernand Léger's experimental film *Ballet mécanique* (1924). *Ballet mécanique* is an important and influential work within European modernist art of the early 20th century. Using aggressively experimental film techniques and subject matter, Léger created a new kind of image.

To produce her work, *Après Ballet mécanique*, Frid-Jimenez takes a similarly experimental approach, using Léger's film to construct a learning set---the dataset of images used to "train" an artificial neural network---and then reconstruct a new version of the film from within the multidimensional image space produced by the neural network. The result is a very different film, reflecting a sense of time, space and form that is firmly rooted in the age of artificial intelligence.
