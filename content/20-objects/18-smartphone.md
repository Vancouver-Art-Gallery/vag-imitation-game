The contemporary smartphone is a miracle in your pocket, packing far more computing power than the multimillion dollar supercomputer Deep Blue that defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.

The list of devices and functions that the smartphone has replaced is long and still growing. In daily life, the smartphone has mostly replaced what were previously stand-alone devices---still cameras, video cameras, audio recorders, music players, radios, personal computers, internet browsers, video game players, roadmaps and navigators, calendars and planners, address books, printed books, even the humble flashlight. And yes, the telephone!

AI is a key part of the smartphone story---from its manufacturing to its day-to-day functioning---and it is also the result of the smartphone explosion in the following ways:

-   AI is used to design smartphones---especially in the design and circuit mapping of the complex and extraordinarily powerful computer chips at the core of current smartphones.

-   New model smartphones are designed to run AI software (particularly neural networks) very quickly and efficiently, turning them into powerful and specialized AI computers. The monitors in this exhibition highlight just a few of the apps that run neural networks locally on the smartphone.

-   Smartphones are the eyes and ears of the AI revolution. The neural networks at the centre of current AI practice are trained with data---images, text, sound---from the real world. People don't just take trillions of photos on smartphones per year, they upload them, meaning that billions of smartphone users worldwide are creating the data that trains modern AI software. Any smartphone app that uses AI to analyze and process images (such as Snapchat Lens, RefaceAI and Google Lens) utilizes neural networks that were trained by this vast and growing ocean of data uploaded from smartphones around the world.

{% accordion ' ## Smartphone Sensors' %}

AI is not just about processing information---it is also about sensing and collecting information from the outside world. Every mode of sensing has its own parameters of intelligence and performance, and every smartphone sensor needs its own AI software. Here are just some of the sensors that can be found on current smartphones.

-   Accelerometer: speed and direction of motion
-   Gyroscope: small shifts in physical orientation
-   Magnetometer: digital compass
-   Global Positioning System (GPS): terrestrial location
-   Proximity Sensor: how far objects are from phone
-   Ambient Light Sensor
-   Microphone
-   Touchscreen Sensors
-   Biometric Sensors: fingerprint, iris, full face recognition
-   Pedometer
-   Barcode/QR Code Sensors
-   Barometer: air pressure and altitude
-   Heart Rate Sensor
-   Thermometer

{% accordion ' ## Snapchat Lens' %}'

Snapchat's popular Lens tool is a remarkable collection of AI driven features. Snapchat Lens allows users to modify their face, appearance, lighting, clothing, facial hair, props, even their voice. The process is simple, fast and easy to use. But the underlying artificial intelligences needed to identify facial and environmental features; track them accurately; modify and replace them seamlessly and play them back smoothly are quite sophisticated. Using the AI in Snapchat Lens, users can create animated effects that would have required the efforts of a professional animation studio just a few years ago.

{% accordion ' ## RefaceAI' %}

Deepfakes[^1] are an AI driven phenomena that have the potential to challenge a deeply held belief that "seeing is believing." The AI needed to create a deepfake is substantial---a face must be recognized; properly segmented and labelled; tracked while moving and talking; remapped to another face or body; appropriately lit, and transferred
into the new, fake scene. But this "sophisticated" AI is available to everyday consumers as an amusement in free apps. One of the most popular, Reface, allows for animation of still photos, face swaps with existing video, and animation with popular music tracks.

[^1]: Deepfakes (a portmanteau of 'deep learning' and 'fake') are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness.

{% accordion ' ## Google Pixel 6 Camera' %}

Making a simple snapshot on a smartphone invokes multiple AI programs. The camera autofocuses; automatically finds and enhances faces; senses motion so that it can apply a blurring effect; and adjusts for lighting---especially in low light settings. There is a new feature called "Real Tone" that adjusts exposure and colour balance correction based on the skin tone of the subject to provide more accurate representation of diverse skin tones. Photos can be edited with a "Magic Eraser" that allows for easy removal of unwanted background clutter. The computational photography software that drives the Google camera is designed to run on the new Google Tensor chip, a microprocessor designed specifically for fast, low-power processing of the neural networks that are the foundation of contemporary AI techniques.
