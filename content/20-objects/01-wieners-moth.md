Norbert Wiener was an American mathematician and philosopher who joined the faculty at MIT in 1919. He is renowned for his collaborative work in the 1920s on early computers, and during World War II was active in a small group of creative interdisciplinary thinkers who produced the first intelligent automated machines. This interdisciplinary view spawned several new fields of research including: communications, computation, automation, information theory, neuroscience, and most notably, cybernetics.[^1] The latter was named by Wiener in his book, *Cybernetics: Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine* (1948).

Wiener recognized the value of sharing new ideas with a broad public and played the role of showman well. His "Moth" has a place in a long history of mechanical animals that were used to describe advances in technology and design. In order to build this public representation of "cybernetics," Wiener started from the proposition that all systems---organic, mechanical, social or aesthetic---are defined by their ability to acquire, use, retain and transmit information.

{% accordion ' ## The Moth' %}

In the late 1940s, Norbert Wiener, then a professor at MIT, teamed up with J. Wiesner (from the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics) and a fabricator named H. Singleton to build a demonstration machine.

The machine was a three-wheeled cart with two front facing photocells (sensors that detect light) and two more on the sides. The output from the cells was communicated to the steering mechanism on the front wheel, moving the cart toward or away from a light source. Depending on the intensity of the light, the Moth demonstrated a jittering tremor, which closely resembled animal neurological responses to stimuli observed in current neuroscience studies.

In the images on the right, Wiener poses with the Moth in a portrait for *Life* magazine; a timelapse image traces the path of the Moth as it follows the movement of a flashlight down a corridor; and an open view of the Moth reveals its intricate construction.

{% accordion ' ## Cybernetics and Society' %}

In 1950, Wiener published *The Human Use of Human Beings* in which he decisively described the fundamental role of communication in modern life:

> *It is the thesis of this book that society can only be understood through a study of the messages and the communication facilities which belong to it; and that in the future development of these messages and communication facilities, messages between man and machines, between machines and man, and between machine and machine, are destined to play an ever-increasing part.*

{% accordion ' ## W. Grey Walter\'s Tortoises' %}

W. Grey Walter began his study of mechanical animals in the 1940s as part of his research into the neurophysiology of the brain. Walter, working independently of Norbert Wiener and his circle, saw the value of building simple machines that mimicked the mental processes of humans and animals. Using light-sensitive and touch-sensitive control mechanisms, Walter's "tortoises" responded to their environment---bumping and jostling their way around a room. 

In a 1950 article for *Scientific American*, entitled "An Imitation of Life," Walter described the close relationship between the animal brain and the recent design of computing machines. He went on to argue that his "tortoises" and their behaviours---characterized by "uncertainty, randomness, free will and independence"---illustrated the possibility of a machine consciousness.

{% accordion ' ## The Hopkins Beast' %}

The Hopkins Beast was a mobile robot built in the 1960s at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Like Norbert Wiener's Moth and Grey Walter's "tortoises," the Hopkins Beast was cybernetic, relying on signals, feedback and control systems to govern its responses and movements.

The Hopkins Beast used photocell optics and sonar to navigate the rooms and halls of the Applied Physics Laboratory, while searching for black coloured charging outlets that would allow it to plug-in, charge and then continue its exploration. Stairways, doors, pipes and other obstacles were recognized by ultrasonic transducers and appropriate actions were taken to avoid collision or entrapment. This demonstration of multiple co-ordinated behaviours most closely resembles something like the capacity of a large nucleated cell.

{% accordion ' ## Aibo and Spot' %}

Aibo and Spot are part of a centuries-old tradition of designing machine animals that hold the dual purpose of introducing new technologies and delighting imaginations.
  
Boston Dynamics' Spot is a mobile robot with extraordinary capacity. Unlike its predecessors, it uses onboard artificial intelligence to guide its movement and responses. Employing neural networks built on deep learning models, Spot can analyze objects and environments, and learn from its accumulated data and experiences. Its incredible physical agility is hilariously demonstrated in Boston Dynamics' widely shared video marketing campaigns.
  
Aibo is designed as a human companion. Its lifelike movements and interactions are intended to engage its human owners and to learn from those interactions. A massive array of sensors all over its body feed data to its facial and voice recognition software, and deep learning algorithms train Aibo to respond uniquely to the various individuals that might occupy a household.

{% accordion ' ## Roomba j7' %}

The Roomba j7 vacuum is described as having Home Intelligence---essentially an adaptive artificial intelligence that allows it to map the architecture of your home and to recognize and negotiate any obstacles it encounters. It bears an uncanny resemblance to its machine-animal predecessors and, like Grey Walter's "tortoises," it will seek out its recharging station when its battery runs low.

Computer-controlled by onboard software, the Roomba j7's acoustic sensors calculate the volume of dirt and adjust its cleaning method accordingly. The capacity to independently learn through repetition and error is critical to this robot's success.

Roomba and similar autonomous robotic vacuum cleaners have attracted a large community of hackers who modify the vacuums' components to produce alternative behaviours, or add equipment to extend their capacity. Drawing machines, remote cameras, delivery bots, pet minders---the opportunities are seemingly endless.
