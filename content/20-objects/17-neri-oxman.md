In 2010, Neri Oxman established the MIT Mediated Matter Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is organized as a collaborative, interdisciplinary team that links engineering, computational design and artificial intelligence. Oxman's goal is simple and direct---she seeks to demonstrate how new technologies can inform the future of design and the making of objects. From this starting point Oxman and the MIT Mediated Matter Group have produced an extraordinary body of work.

What does it mean to invent manufacturing practices that grow rather than assemble? What if building components were modelled on human skin, the weavings of a silkworm or the intricate structures of a hive? These are the type of questions that drive the research of Oxman and her collaborators---and have shaped some of the thinking that informs generative design, evolutionary design and parametric architecture.

Contemporary design has established a fundamental link between the algorithm and the organism, and opened the door to new models of complexity and materiality. Colour and opacity, stiffness, softness, shape memory, swellability, expansion, wettability, and refractive index can be seamlessly tuned, fabricated and leveraged in design applications.

A close examination of the natural world and an openness to complexity and new materials and methods have provided the tools to overcome the limitations of traditional mechanical design that favours uniformity and repetition. Offering an antidote to human-centric design, Oxman calls for a "holistic approach which considers all environments---the built, the natural and the biological..."

In 2016, Neri Oxman and the Mediated Matter Group designed an artificial apiary that created a constant spring-like environment for bees. Oxman's concern was a topic of much discussion at that time---the massive decline in bees worldwide due to various factors affecting their health such as agricultural chemicals, disease and habitat loss.

To contribute to this global dialogue, Oxman developed a controlled space in which seasonal honeybees could thrive year-round. This was to be a platform for biological studies of "behavioural dynamics across scales---from the organism scale to the building scale---including bee health, comb-construction behaviours and bee-human interactions."

As part of this research into comb-construction and bee-human interactions, Oxman explored the possibility of co-fabrication and produced an in-depth analysis of the internal architecture and morphology of the bee comb. This was the starting point for research toward the project Synthetic Apiary II that is manifest in Oxman's Bee Cubes.

As a part of her research for the Synthetic Apiary II project, Neri Oxman focused on the ways in which honeybees constructed their combs, recognizing in them a communication system that shapes both the form of the comb and the hive's collective actions. This system of signal, feedback and control is reminiscent of the principles of cybernetics and systems dynamics. When the signals are changed the honeybees respond dynamically to the new information.

The nature of these signals can vary widely---from the use of 3D printed chemical cues, to variations in the comb's magnetic fields, or the integration of designs that change their form and complexity over time.

Summing up her goals for this project, Oxman writes:

> Developing computational tools to learn from bees can facilitate the very beginnings of a dialogue with them. Refined by evolution over hundreds of thousands of years, their comb-building behaviors and social organizations may reveal new forms and methods of formation that can be applied across our human endeavors in architecture, design, engineering, and culture.
