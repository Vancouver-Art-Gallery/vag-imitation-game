The Algorithmic Justice League (AJL) was formed in 2016 by Joy Buolamwini, a computer scientist and digital activist. The AJL began its work with a decisive critique of the facial recognition software that had been rapidly adopted by most of the major tech companies---Microsoft, Facebook, Google, IBM, Megvii, Tencent, and so on---to produce their own databases and sell their services to a wide variety of commercial and public enterprises in 2015.

In 2016, Boulamwini debuted a short documentary video, *The Coded Gaze: Unmasking Algorithmic Bias*, at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In it, she questioned the implications of facial recognition software that refused to recognize her until she placed a white mask on her face. What were the systems of bias that produced this software? What are the biases perpetuated by this widely used software?

> "*Through a combination of art, research, policy guidance and media advocacy, the Algorithmic Justice League is leading a cultural movement towards equitable and accountable AI. This requires us to look at how AI systems are developed and to actively prevent the harmful use of AI systems. We aim to empower communities and galvanize decision makers to take action that mitigates the harms and biases of AI.*" ---AJL.org

With this clear and compelling statement, the AJL introduces its call for action based in two fundamental principles: Equitable AI and Accountable AI. Equitable AI offers agency and control for people that interact with AI; affirms consent for all interactions with AI systems; and prohibits unjust use of AI by government systems. Accountable AI demonstrates meaningful transparency, continuous oversight, and redress for harm caused in the use of AI.

The AJL produces exhibitions, documentaries, spoken-word performances and events, and public talks and panels. Its many publications advocate for change and for meaningful oversight and regulation of artificial intelligence.

Critical challenges to the ungoverned and unethical use of facial recognition databases and software come from many different sources, and some of the most interesting critiques have emerged from artists with interdisciplinary practices.
