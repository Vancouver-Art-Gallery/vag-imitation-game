*Cybernetic Serendipity: The Computer and the Arts* was a landmark exhibition mounted at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London, in 1968, and organized by Jasia Reichardt, curator and associate director of the ICA.

Drawing on the term "cybernetics" that had been popularized by Norbert Wiener twenty years earlier, the exhibition explored the potential for advanced technologies to enable new modes of creativity. This was a new age of interdisciplinarity, and the exhibition highlighted collaborations between more than 300 artists, composers, performers, scientists and engineers. The concept of "serendipity" was a theme taken up in many of the individual works, and notions of play, chance and surprise were common threads throughout.

The exhibition was divided into three sections:

-   Computer-generated graphics, computer-animated films, computer-composed and played music, and computer poems and texts;

-   Cybernetic devices as works of art, cybernetic environments, remote control robots and painting machines;

-   A "learning zone" with machines demonstrating the uses of computers, and an environment dealing with the history of cybernetics.

The extensive catalogue for the *Cybernetic Serendipity* exhibition was first published in 1968 as a special issue of *Studio International*, an influential art magazine based in London. Under the editorial leadership of Peter Townsend, *Studio International* endorsed interdisciplinary practices, new technologies and an international community of cultural producers.

With more than 100 pages and 300 images---and featuring contributions by dozens of experts in various fields---the publication was both a primer on the history of the computer, and an avant-garde statement on the uses of new technologies in art, music, poetry, dance, graphics, architecture, installation, and environmental art and film.

The cover of the catalogue and exhibition poster, which incorporated computer graphics from the exhibition, was designed by the Polish-British painter, filmmaker and stage designer Franciszka Themerson.

Much of the original exhibition was subsequently shown at the Corcoran Annex in Washington, D.C., and then at the newly opened Exploratorium in San Francisco in 1969.


{% accordion ' ## John H. Whitney, Permutations' %}

John H. Whitney was an animator, filmmaker and key figure in the early development of computer graphics. His collaboration on the animated title sequence for Alfred Hitchcock's *Vertigo* in 1958 was widely acknowledged for its innovation and dynamic imagery---including the spirographic images (based on the mathematical forms known as Lissajous curves[^1]) that also feature prominently in *Permutations*.

Whitney saw the computer as a fundamental tool to link music and visual art. Through the use of sound and computer graphics, he created harmonic events in audio-visual presentations. He describes the process as follows:

> *In* Permutations *each point moves at a different speed and moves in a direction independent according to natural laws quite as valid as those of Pythagoras, while moving in their circular field. Their action produces a phenomenon more or less equivalent to the musical harmonies. When the points reach certain relationships (harmonic) numerical to other parameters of the equation, they form elementary figures.*

{% accordion ' ## Tony Pritchett, The Flexipede' %}

*The Flexipede* had its premiere in *Cybernetic Serendipity*, and was reputed to be the first computer-generated animated film made in the UK. Tony Pritchett produced it on the University of London's Atlas Computer (one of the world's first supercomputers) using FORTRAN IV---a programming language that was employed in computationally intensive research, such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, and so on. FORTRAN IV was widely used by artists and programmers in the *Cybernetic Serendipity* exhibition.

Pritchett wrote the subroutines (program instructions) using punch cards, then transferred the output to tape using a FORTRAN-based graphics software package called GHOST. The tapes were used to produce an output on a plotter printer and then filmed by a microfilm recorder.

{% accordion ' ## Alison Knowles, The House of Dust' %}

Alison Knowles is renowned for her work as an artist in a diverse range of media including performance, installation, sound works and publications. She was a founding member of Fluxus---an international, interdisciplinary group of artists, composers, designers and poets active during the 1960s. Her poem, *The House of Dust*, was conceived in collaboration with James Tenney, a composer-in-residence at Bell Labs in New Jersey, and an expert on the IBM compiling system known as FORTRAN.

Knowles' interest in chance and indeterminacy coincided with Tenney's interest in the manipulation and generation of information, and their collaboration was first shown in *Cybernetic Serendipity*. It took the form of computer-generated poems compiled in four randomly generated lines---indicating a type of house; a material, a site or situation; a light source; and a category of inhabitants.

The resulting poems are surprisingly evocative, and full of humour and absurdity. For Knowles, they also offered an opportunity for a compelling meditation on dwelling and architecture. In 1968, she designed and built *The House of Dust* structure, later installing it at CalArts in Valencia, California, when she moved there to teach in 1969.
