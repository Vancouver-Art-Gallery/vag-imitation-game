Different than a typical computer game, *SimCity* is a city simulator---each player (or "SimCity Mayor") designs and manages their own city, placing buildings, roads, railroads and power lines; setting civic spending priorities; and making key policy decisions such as tax rates, zoning, and the construction of prisons or military facilities. For many players, the potential disasters---earthquakes, tornadoes, fires and even giant monsters---were the most fun part of the gaming experience. *SimCity* has been credited with inspiring a generation of urban planners and government officials.

Urban planning and governance are highly complex and fraught with unforeseen interactions and outcomes. Consequently, this area was an early topic of interest for the application of computer simulations and artificial intelligence, notably in the early research and publications of Jay Forrester. More recently, focus has shifted from simulating possible outcomes to using AI programs to monitor and control various systems in real-life cities. Google Sidewalk Labs' Sidewalk Toronto project offers a striking representation of the issues raised by this recent development in urban design.

The original 1989 edition of *SimCity* introduced the basic components that would evolve throughout the 25-year lifetime of the game. Through simple, colourful graphics, *SimCity* put the power of computer simulation into the hands of millions.

These video clips present a sample of the features in the original 1989 edition. On a simple map, players can design and manage a city; watch it grow (sometimes in unexpected ways, similar to the pioneering urban simulations of Jay Forrester); and respond to a rich and entertaining set of disasters. *SimCity*, in contrast to most computer games of the era, was open-ended, noncompetitive and impossible to win or lose, leading the publisher to market it as a "software toy."

*SimCity*'s creator, Will Wright, went on to create *The Sims* and *Spore*, and pioneered an entire genre of simulator-based games.

Jay Forrester pioneered the field of system dynamics---the use of computer simulations to model complex systems and interactions. One of the areas that he and his colleagues at MIT tackled was urban dynamics---the behaviour and sometimes surprising interactions of the various policies and processes that shape a city. Forrester's dedication to clear mental models and rigorous computer simulations produced an early and influential real-world use of computer intelligence.

After publishing *Urban Dynamics* in 1969, he expanded his work to a global scale, tackling issues of world economy, population and the environment in *World Dynamics*, published in 1971. Here, he notably predicts the collapse of our socio-technological-natural system by the mid-21st century. In addition to influencing a generation of urban planners and computer scientists, Forrester has been cited by game designer Will Wright as one of the main inspirations behind the urban simulation video game, *SimCity*.

A "Smart City" uses technology to collect information, make decisions and manage municipal processes intelligently. In contrast to the purely "what if" simulations of Jay Forrester and the video game, *SimCity*, Smart City systems are taking on a growing role in the actual management of many facets of urban life---transportation, power, water, health services, zoning, crime detection, and, most controversially, surveillance. AI and the Internet of Things (IoT)---things not normally considered to be computers connected to the internet---combine to create a vision of a city as a linked information system whose management can be analyzed and optimized by AI algorithms. Among the many examples of Smart City initiatives, Sidewalk Toronto, which launched in 2015 (and abruptly ended in 2020), was notable for the number of commercial spin-offs it generated.
