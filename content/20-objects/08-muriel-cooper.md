In 1973, Muriel Cooper founded the Visible Language Workshop (VLW) at MIT, where she played a pivotal role in the exploration of computer graphics and typography in modern design. The principal mission of the VLW was to develop design strategies and devices for manipulating information in dynamic contexts. In 1985, the VLW was amalgamated with MIT's Architecture Machine Group and the Center for Advanced Visual Studies to form the MIT Media Lab, which became one of the most influential centres for the study of artificial intelligence in the world.

One of Cooper's key areas of interest was responsive design[^1] systems, incorporating feedback (in the cybernetic sense) into the design process---feedback that responded dynamically to the environment (space and context) of the design. She also focused on layering information, again using 3D space (advancing, receding, rotating) as a key design element.

Today, it is hard to imagine a time before 3D graphic design, but Cooper was the leading proponent of a new field of visual design. Her work broke the flat space of conventional design and replaced it with a new interface that had depth and movement, and was responsive to input. Concepts such as "behavioural graphics," "intelligent type," and "on-the-fly-scaling" required complex algorithms and powerful computers to be realized, and Cooper relied on the most sophisticated graphics computers and programmers of the day to achieve her vision.

In 1993, Silicon Graphics---a leading producer of high performance computer graphics hardware and software---loaned the Visible Language Workshop a computer running their Reality Engine, which allowed Muriel Cooper and her team to experiment with type in motion. With a content limit of a few hundred words and a frame rate of 30 frames per second, the Reality Engine had a lower capacity than many of today's smartphones. But at the time, it allowed for a whole new concept of dynamic text as well as a fundamental reconfiguration of the space of graphic design.

In 1994, Cooper presented *Information Landscapes* at the TED5 Conference in Monterey, California. This video offered a radical new model of computer interface design. Information was no longer restricted to a 2D linear space, but could now be produced as a landscape to explore in 3D. And with this change came new design tools---blur, transparency, layering, infinite zoom---as well as a new concept of interaction. The reader was now replaced by a user who moved through a 3D space---navigating, browsing, digging deeper.

Pentagram is a renowned international design firm that was founded in London in 1972 within a community of interdisciplinary producers. Among its former partners was Lisa Strausfeld, who was a student at the Visual Language Workshop (VLW) when *Information Landscapes* (1994) was produced. Strausfeld's contribution to the video was the design of the "Financial Viewpoints" project, which offered a 3D visualization of Morningstar's mutual fund data.

Muriel Cooper's influential thinking is widely acknowledged at Pentagram. In 2017---to honour the fiftieth anniversary of Cooper joining the MIT Press---Pentagram created a motion graphic salute to her foresight and immense influence on contemporary graphic design.

The MIT Press colophon or logotype designed by Cooper is an archetype for modern logo typography. Designed thirty years before *Information Landscapes*, it bridges the gap between Bauhaus modernism and the VLW's "computationally expressive" graphics.

Pentagram is a leader in algorithmic design, which allows for modelling of complex geometries that would be impossible to produce by hand. Following in the tradition of Muriel Cooper's dynamic forms and on-the-fly scaling, Pentagram's designs are driven by complex algorithms that respond to their physical and conceptual contexts.

Cytora is a London-based company that uses AI to learn and evaluate risk patterns for the insurance industry, making assessments in real time at a granular level by relying on a continuous flow of data. In developing a brand identity for the company, Pentagram drew on the dynamic flow of information that drives Cytora's "Risk Engine." The defining motif is a system of constantly moving and shifting coloured blocks, which alludes to risk fluctuations and the intersecting data that form the "Risk Engine's" assessment.

Covariant is a Berkeley-based AI robotics company that uses computer vision and neural networks to allow robots to adapt, learn and work in diverse environments. Pentagram's brand identity references the "Covariant Brain," AI software that gives robots the capacity to flow from one environment to another and adapt dynamically based on the context.
