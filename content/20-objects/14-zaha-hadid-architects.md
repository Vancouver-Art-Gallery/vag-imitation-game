Zaha Hadid was first among a cohort of international architects who embraced the tools of parametric architecture,[^1] giving shape to a concept of design that was fundamentally informed by the principles and tools of artificial intelligence.

Parametric design starts from simple suppositions: a building has height, width and depth; it has walls, floors and a roof; there are doors and windows. These are basic parameters that can be expressed in numbers and forms. There are infinite possibilities for the relations between these parameters, and the many more parameters that can be introduced. When parameters are expressed as algorithms---a recipe or list of instructions that produce a limited series of correlated operations---they can then be combined to generate an infinite variety of forms or permutations. At its very heart, parametric design is fundamentally relational, and finds its closest and most influential models in the world of nature, the organic, the biological and the genetic.

Building on techniques devised by digital animators in the mid-1990s, technologists, architects and software engineers developed advanced parametric design systems that allowed architects to use algorithms to produce complex, intricately interwoven designs, as well as innovative fabrication technologies to build those radical designs.

To design the Morpheus Hotel, Hadid, working closely with Patrik Schumacher (a principal at her firm), began with a simple constraint: they would use the existing foundation of an abandoned condominium project as the starting point for an extrusion that would rise up forty storeys with two internal circulation cores connected at street level and roof level. This large rectangular block was then "carved" with three voids that pierce the rectangle, creating a unique surface and extraordinary light inside and outside the building.

The building's program of use is complex, involving an intricate interplay of public and private spaces as is typical of most hotels. The interior design follows many of the parameters used for the external structure, exploiting the capacity of parametric design to accommodate dramatic shifts in scale. Because the building is primarily supported with its unique exoskeleton, the interior spaces---largely freed from traditional structural constraints---are given an open and organic latticework treatment.

> *"Morpheus draws on ZHA's 40 years of research into the integration of interior and exterior, civic and private, solid and void, Cartesian and Einsteinian. Space is woven within structure to tie disparate programmes together and constantly make connections."*---Zaha Hadid Architects

{% accordion ' ## Antoni Gaudí and Luigi Moretti' %}

While contemporary parametric architecture requires vast computational power, the history of architectural design includes some notable architects who used parametric principles in the prototyping and design of their buildings.

Antoni Gaudí's legendary designs for La Sagrada Família Church and the Colònia Güell Chapel were achieved using a unique process combining ropes, weights, canvas and gravity, known as a funicular system.[^2] To calculate his designs, Gaudí hung ropes and chains attached to lead-filled sacks from the ceiling, arranged to reflect his preliminary drawings. Canvas was used to simulate the walls and vaults of the structure. By manipulating the length and location of the ropes and chains, Gaudí could alter the design, but maintain a clear understanding of the loads that would be exerted on the actual building. When a design was chosen, the structure was photographed, and the image was then traced and flipped to provide a viable design for the builders.

Luigi Moretti's designs for a stadium were exhibited in the *Parametric Architecture* exhibition at the Milan Triennial XII (1960), and are generally regarded as the first representation of modern parametric architecture. His designs for Stadium N were achieved with nineteen parameters that included viewing angles and the economic cost of concrete.

[^2]: The funicular concept can be best described and visualized with cables or chains, suspended from two points, that adjust their form for any load in tension.

{% accordion ' ## Frank Gehry, Toyo Ito and Rem Koolhaas' %}

Frank Gehry's fascination with materials and flowing surfaces requires an intensive computational process to transform his simple models in cardboard or wood into fluid and gleaming architectural forms like the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Gehry's studio played a key role in customizing the CATIA 3D modelling software used in the aerospace industry for architectural applications.

Toyo Ito's design for the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion was derived from a cube that expanded as it was rotated. The fragmented shapes that arise from seven iterations of this parametrically determined process of rotation and extrusion form the external structure of the Pavilion.

Rem Koolhaas and OMA's CCTV building in Beijing achieves its uncanny presence through the principles of parametric design. Its confounding form was produced through a process of design optimization that balanced the architects' conceptual and aesthetic goals with engineering and fabrication needs.

{% accordion ' ## Melike Altinisik' %}

Melike Altinisik's supple design for the Çamlıca TV and Radio Tower reflects her focused interest in natural forms and forces. Altinisik described the design methodology as a computational process that allowed for integrated information gathering, which included the variables of the building's multi-purpose program, the engineering challenges of a super-tall tower, and its multiple viewpoints within the city and surrounding landscape. The building's flowing parametric curves suggest the movement of wind, and echo the undulating landscape that shapes Istanbul and the Bosporus.

[^1]: Parametric design is understood as a process where a description of a problem is created using variables. By changing these variables a range of alternative solutions can be created, then based on some criteria a final solution selected.
