*2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968) is a landmark in the representation of artificial intelligence in visual culture. From the earliest moments of the film, we are cast about in space and time in ways that distort and upend our perceptions of reality. At the centre of the film is the HAL 9000 computer. HAL is the acronym for a Heuristically programmed Algorithmic computer---which is to say, a computer optimized for problem solving, self-discovery and decision-making, though inherently vulnerable to error. It is adept at independently controlling complex machines, interacting with humans in ways that would certainly pass the Turing Test, and using computer vision to track a wide range of activities, including the reading of lips.

Left to its own devices, HAL suspects that the humans are sabotaging the planned mission to Jupiter, and it begins to restrict their control, finally deciding to kill them in order to save the mission. But Bowman narrowly escapes, and makes his way to HAL's computer processing core where he methodically disconnects the various circuits that produce HAL's consciousness. HAL maintains a calm and controlled voice trying to assure Bowman that it can change its plan. But as Bowman slowly deactivates HAL's memory, it begs Bowman to stop, expressing its fear, its feeling of loss---then finally devolving to its earliest operational state.

At this point in the film, viewers are invited to consider our limited assumptions about the nature of sentience, and, specifically, its formation in machines.

The film's director, Stanley Kubrick, and his co-writer for the screenplay, Arthur C. Clarke, conceived of an artificial intelligence that had achieved a consciousness that closely resembled that of humans---recognizing within this a very real likelihood of fallibility.

The question of fallibility and error(s) in judgement produced by the actions of an artificial intelligence is a persistent theme, from the 1950s onward, in literature, art and, most notably, film.


{% accordion ' ## Samuel Butler' %}

Samuel Butler was a British novelist and cultural critic. His novel *Erewhon: or, Over the Range* was published anonymously in 1872 and takes the form of a utopian narrative of place. Three chapters in the book are identified as "The Book of Machines," and they describe a society with a conflicted relationship to machines. Citing Charles Darwin's theories on evolution, Butler represents a world with machines that have evolved consciousness and threaten to transform in ways that cannot be controlled by humans:

> *I would repeat that I fear none of the existing machines; what I fear is the extraordinary rapidity with which they are becoming something very different to what they are at present. No class of beings have in any time past made so rapid a movement forward. Should not that movement be jealously watched, and checked while we can still check it? And is it not necessary for this end to destroy the more advanced of the machines which are in use at present, though it is admitted that they are in themselves harmless?*

{% accordion ' ## The Matrix' %}

The Wachowskis' film, *The Matrix* (1999), set new standards in the use of computer driven special effects in film, and offered an enduringly tangible representation of a simulated world run by an artificial intelligence.

Dreams play an integral part in our perception of consciousness. At its furthest extension, the world of dreams opens the door to the possibility that the world we experience is itself a dream. *The Matrix* takes this ancient narrative and turns it toward the world of artificial intelligence. What if our lives are nothing more than a highly effective virtual reality seamlessly rendered by a very powerful computer? Once again, the narrative of an all-controlling artificial intelligence challenges our complacency and demands vigilance over the machine.

The special effects in *The Matrix* are legendary. By using complex virtual cinematography to choreograph the real camera movements, they were able to achieve new and compelling camera angles that give the film its otherworldliness. And give us yet another instance of the virtual world seizing control of the real world.

{% accordion ' ## Ex Machina' %}

This scene from the 2014 film *Ex Machina* by writer and director Alex Garland describes an encounter between Caleb and Ava. Caleb is a young programmer who has been brought to the home of Nathan, a wealthy software developer, to test the capacity of a new robot with artificial intelligence named Ava. In an early meeting, Caleb asks Ava a series of questions that recall the parameters of a Turing Test. Ava later turns the tables on Caleb by asking a series of penetrating questions that reveal a compelling intelligence on its part. The larger narrative of the film is also introduced in this scene when Ava warns Caleb that the developer is a dangerous liar.

The conventional narrative of a dangerous artificial intelligence is here played in reverse; Nathan, and not the robot, is the threatening and unpredictable consciousness that seeks to control the world. But in his representation of artificial intelligence, Garland seems unable to move beyond the conventions of overt sexualization and gendered stereotyping used in the depiction of robots, and, apparently, software developers.

{% accordion ' ## Ben Bogart' %}

Ben Bogart's video installation *Watching (2001: A Space Odyssey)* offers an intricate interaction with Stanley Kubrick's film *2001: A Space Odyssey*. This interaction takes the form of an active watching in which the image and sound of the original film are disassembled and then reconstituted using complex algorithms embedded in statistically oriented machine learning[^1] and computer vision[^2] programs.

The reconstituted film is strangely familiar but the space and time that it describes is ordered in a new and compelling way. Those who have seen Kubrick's version may struggle to reconcile the old with the new, but the reward comes in surrendering one's preconceptions, and watching closely the pattern, movement and sounds rendered by Bogart's artificial intelligence.

In this unexpected way, we are offered the surprising opportunity to witness an artificial intelligence "watching" a film, which is itself a study of artificial intelligence, consciousness and perception, across space and time.
