"I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'" With this deceptively simple declaration Alan Turing started a conversation that has resonated for more than 70 years, and has decisively shaped the development of artificial intelligence.

Alan Turing was an English-born mathematician, computer scientist, philosopher and theoretical biologist. Turing's early research provided the theoretical framework for a universal computing machine. As a cryptologist at Bletchley Park during World War II, he showed the power of computing in mechanizing expert human procedures and judgements. In the latter years of the War, he began to speculate that machines could simulate the operation of human brains.

The "Imitation Game" is the name of a test that Turing sketched out in his landmark paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950). Taking a simple party game as the starting point for his analysis, Turing described a scenario involving three subjects: a person, a machine and an interrogator. The interrogator is placed in a separate room and asked to question the machine and the person in a way that will help the interrogator decide which respondent is human.

The seeming simplicity of this test was not lost on Turing, and in his paper, he also considers the validity of various possible objections to his proposition: the Theological Objection, the Mathematical Objection, the Lady Lovelace Objection, and so on. Turing concluded his paper with the observation that new developments in computing machine design---including the possibility of a "learning machine" based on the model of child learning---should be actively pursued.

Ultimately, Turing intended the "Imitation Game" as a tool to think about the possibility of a future computing machine, and the conditions that might be needed to achieve that goal.

Turing's "Imitation Game," or the Turing Test[^1] as it was later called, affirms the human mind as the ideal model for the formulation of a thinking machine. This isn't a surprising conceit: humans have long imagined themselves as the ideal model for most things. But Turing chooses to illustrate his argument with a test that is also based in doubt, confusion and ambiguity. This may be a game, he seems to suggest, but what are the implications of a thinking machine that could fool us into believing it is human?

{% accordion ' ## Mechanical Turk' %}

The history of automata (or self-operating machines) is as old as human civilization, with examples of automata found in China, Greece and North Africa hundreds of years before the common era. Mechanical animals were a favourite subject, but in 18th century Europe sophisticated human automata became popular.

In 1770, a chess playing automaton was created by Wolfgang von Kempelen. It immediately captured the imagination of large audiences and toured Europe and North America until it was destroyed in a fire in 1854. The automaton was regarded as a skilled player and won most of the games played while on tour.

The possibility of an intelligent machine that could play chess (and defeat humans) has been a persistent dream for hundreds of years, but it wasn't until the construction of IBM's Deep Blue in 1997 that machines consistently achieved that goal. Von Kempelen's Mechanical Turk[^2] was unfortunately a ruse; the machine was in fact guided by the hand of a human chess-master who was elaborately hidden in the interior of the cabinet.

Dressed in Ottoman robes and a turban, Von Kempelen's automaton was dubbed the casually racist moniker "the Mechanical Turk," undoubtedly with the intent to acknowledge the early adoption of chess in Persia and the Middle East. It was also just as likely an attempt to appeal to the exoticism and Orientalism that persistently shaped European perceptions of the Middle East during the 18th and 19th centuries.

{% accordion ' ## Ada Lovelace' %}

Citing the likely objections of Ada Lovelace to his question "Can machines think?," Alan Turing devoted a subsection of his "Computing Machinery" paper to her thoughts on the likelihood of an "engine" that might compose or weave according to its own criteria. It is a remarkable "conversation" in which Turing anticipates and counters what he imagines would be Lovelace's objections, nearly 100 years after her death.

Lovelace was a mathematician, scientist and writer who worked closely with Charles Babbage, the inventor of the Difference Engine (a mechanical calculator), and the Analytical Engine (essentially a programmable computer). In 1843, in her notes for a published translation of Babbage's 1840 lecture on the analytical Engine, Lovelace speculated on the engine's potential use on things other than numbers:

> *Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.*

In other notes, Lovelace expresses doubt that the engine could be truly creative or produce something new. Rather, she believes that the engine would compose only what it was instructed to compose. Turing acknowledges why Lovelace might make this objection, but also offers a counter argument: we should be open to "surprises" when considering the capacity of machines, and that creativity (a "creative mental act") was certainly not out of the question, especially in the case of a "learning machine."

{% accordion ' ## The Voight-Kampff Machine Test' %}

In 1982, Ridley Scott adapted Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* to produce the film *Blade Runner*. It is a dystopian story set in a near future (2019) in which synthetic humans called "replicants" have escaped from their job as forced labourers on distant off-world colonies. Rick Deckard is a retired "blade runner" brought back to hunt down a particularly virulent group of replicants.

The replicants are bio-engineered androids---highly sophisticated robots made of flesh-like material---who have begun to show increasing independence of thought and highly complex emotions. Some replicants have been given false memories and have no awareness of their identity.

Deckard, and other blade runners, administer a test---the Voight-Kampff Test---to distinguish between humans and replicants. It is, of course, a Turing Test, but with ominous consequences, as the discovered replicants are quickly and violently dispatched. The test used in the film has many of the characteristics of a polygraph or lie detector test, but with a focus on empathy rather than intelligence. The questions asked by the interrogator are emotionally charged; the replicant's response is measured by observing breathing, heart rate and pupillary response.

Syd Mead was a renowned concept artist whose futuristic visions gave shape to a wide range of films including *Blade Runner* (1982), *Tron* (1982), *Aliens* (1986), and *Johnny Mnemonic* (1995). For these films he developed the look of entire cities, crowded streetscapes, and elaborate electronic vehicles and equipment that gave a gritty realism to even the most fantastical ideas.

Mead's concept drawing for the Voight-Kampff machine is at once futuristic and anachronistic. It is an intricate automated device with 19th century embellishments such as mechanical bellows and a stylized monocle. In the hands of Rick Deckard, the interrogator who administers the Voight-Kampff test, the machine is a menacing beast that appears to breathe and move of its own accord.
