Developed by Google subsidiary, DeepMind, AlphaGo is a computer program that plays Go, a popular strategy game. AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol---a best out of five Go tournament held in Seoul, South Korea in March 2016---pitted Go master Lee against the computer program. AlphaGo employed several deep neural networks, which it trained by playing against itself and strengthened with reinforcement learning[^1]. In other words, AlphaGo learned more from its own experience than it did from the experts who programmed it.

Before the match, a confident Lee predicted that he would sweep all five games. "It is just a program," he said, "lacking insight and creativity." Lee was devastated by his loss to AlphaGo in Game 1.

However, what really confounded experts and Lee was the unorthodox Move 37 by AlphaGo in Game 2. The international Go masters who were providing commentary for the match thought that AlphaGo might have made an error. Even the AlphaGo team was surprised. As the game progressed, it became clear that Move 37 was a brilliant, even creative move that pivoted the game and set it off in a new direction. AlphaGo "knew" that it was an unusual move---it had calculated that there was less than a 1 in 10,000 chance that a human would have made the same move. AlphaGo went on to win Game 2, as well as Games 3 and 5.

{% accordion ' ## Mechanical Turk'%}

The "Mechanical Turk" was an elaborate mechanical device that its inventor claimed could play chess. In fact, a small but very skilled chess-player hid within its base and directed all its moves. This elaborate hoax toured Europe, Canada and the United States from the 1770s until its destruction by fire in 1854. This early representation of the possibility of machine intelligence was part of a broader fascination with complex machines in the 18th and 19th centuries, enabled by concurrent advances in science and technology.

{% accordion ' ## Deep Blue vs. Garry Kasparov'%}

In 1996 and 1997, two six-game chess matches were held between then reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov and Deep Blue, a chess-playing program run on an IBM supercomputer. Deep Blue won the match and triggered yet another debate about "what do we really mean by 'intelligence?'" Deep Blue was programmed long before the current revolution of self-trained neural networks and depended on an extensive set of rules given to it by a team of chess experts. Modern techniques using neural networks require far less human training and intervention, and produce better results.

{% accordion ' ## Financial Markets' %}

Every day, millions of people worldwide play a game called "investing" in which enormous sums of money are won and lost. Investing is rooted in the same mathematical principles of game theory[^2] that form the foundation of any competition. The "quant revolution" in financial markets has introduced many of the same AI techniques of quantitative data analysis used to play games, such as chess and Go, into the investment arena.

Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
