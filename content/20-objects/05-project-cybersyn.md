Using some of the basic principles of cybernetics theory---communication and control---Stafford Beer, a consultant to the newly-elected Salvador Allende government (1970--73), devised a plan to enable a dynamic, socialist-driven transformation of the Chilean economy.

Building on Jay Forrester's theories of system dynamics[^1], and specifically his book *Industrial Dynamics* (1961), Beer laid out a strategy to capture information feedback from workers, managers, suppliers, shippers and consumers across the country. This data was used to produce a list of relevant indicators that could be monitored and, in turn, used to make adjustments in planning or to redirect goods and supplies.

Project Cybersyn was composed of four key elements: a national network of teletype machines that would capture information in real time; an IBM System/360 Model 50 computer (1965) running a purpose-built version of Dynamo software for simulating system dynamics models; an Operations Room where ongoing analysis of the received data would provide key indicators; and the resulting indicators used to provide feedback to the producers, shippers and consumers, and to make necessary adjustments.

After two years of development, Project Cybersyn launched in February 1973. Beer struggled to maintain the project's goal for greater worker autonomy within a system that was consultative at all levels. These concerns, however, were overshadowed by the Allende government's struggle to maintain its autonomy. In September 1973, Allende was murdered in a CIA-backed military coup led by General Pinochet, and the Cybersyn Operations Room was destroyed.

{% accordion ' ## The Operations Room' %}

The Operations Room was a key element of Project Cybersyn. Symbolically, its design by Gui Bonsiepe reflected the forward thinking modernism that informed the project as a whole. The Operations Room was a nexus for the information that flowed in and out of the teletypes and mainframe computer. The design team was led by Bonsiepe---a German-born designer trained at the famed Ulm School of Design---who was working as a design consultant in South America during the 1970s. When the Room was up and running in early 1973, a small team of designers were also employed to design the data projected on the screens in real time.

Reflecting Bonsiepe's training at Ulm, the Room was designed with a strict adherence to the principles of gestalt design---closure, proximity, similarity, continuity, perception, organization and symmetry. The seven swivel chairs allow the whole Room to be seen in a glance, and support intimate, egalitarian conversation.

The annotated images used in the video slideshow are a selection of drawings, diagrams and photographic documentation that offer some insights into the planning and design of Project Cybersyn.

{% accordion ' ## Designing Freedom' %}

In this excerpt from Stafford Beer's Massey Lectures for CBC Radio (1973), Beer concludes the six-part series with a plea to recognize the fundamental role of new technologies in designing new models of freedom; and the threat to that freedom if those technologies are mishandled. This conclusion to the lecture series was hastily revised to acknowledge the ongoing coup in Chile. Using the language of cybernetics theory, Beer cites the actions of the Pinochet junta as "the output of a system designed to curb liberty, my message is that we must redesign that system to produce freedom as an output."

{% accordion ' ## Simulacron-3 and The Tunnel under the World' %}

Daniel F. Galouye's *Simulacron-3* tells the story of a computer-generated city simulation that was created to fill the needs of a marketing research company. The simulation is so realistic that the city's inhabitants don't realize they are living in a virtual world.

Frederick Pohl's short story, "The Tunnel under the World," is an early example of a simulated world built by a corporate entity that uses the town's inhabitants---recently annihilated in an industrial accident and
recreated as minuscule robots---to test hard sell marketing strategies.

These stories are part of a science fiction subgenre, which emerged in the 1950s and 60s and addressed a growing and unregulated world of corporate marketing and research based in computer intensive systems analysis. This marketing research was rooted in an analysis of the values, choices and desires of increasingly large segments of population. Data gathered through polls, interviews and consumer sales was used to build massive simulations that would confidently predict the future.

{% accordion ' ## World on a Wire' %}

*World on a Wire* was a two-part television miniseries directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and made for German television. Inspired by Daniel F. Galouye's novel *Simulacron-3* (1964), Fassbinder's film depicts a near-future world in which the Cybernetics and Future Science Institute runs a massive virtual world on its supercomputer named Simulacron. The world contains thousands of "identity units" who exist and go about their everyday lives oblivious of the fact that they are simulations.

In the video excerpt shown here, the newly appointed director of the Institute, Dr. Fred Stiller, enters the simulation to investigate a sudden death (the Institute's previous director) and a rogue unit named Einstein. Einstein has become self-aware and realizes that he is a simulation. He begs Stiller to take him to the real world.

The notion of a hidden, simulated world is a consistent trope in the narratives of artificial intelligence. *World on a Wire* tells the story of a scientific institute that uses a simulation program to predict the future of steel prices for a giant corporation. And its source material, Galouye's *Simulacron-3,* pointed to the world of marketing and its use of simulations to predict trends. Both drew on a growing public awareness of the power of computing and the manipulation of public opinion in real life through entities such as the Simulmatics Corporation, which played a critical role in American politics and the Vietnam War during the 1960s.
